        One day, the maidservants being engaged in other work, mother 
Yasoda was churning the yogurt into butter herself, and in the meantime 
Krishna came and requested her to allow Him to suck her breast milk. Of 
course, mother Yasoda immediately allowed Him to do so, but then she 
saw that the hot milk on the oven was boiling over, and therefore she immediately stopped allowing Krishna to drink the milk of her breast and 
went to stop the milk on the oven from overflowing. Krishna, however, 
having been interrupted in His business of sucking the breast, was very 
angry. He took a piece of stone, broke' the churning pot and entered a 
room, where He began to eat the freshly churned butter. When mother 
Yasoda, after attending to the overflowing milk, returned and saw the pot 
broken, she could understand that this was the work of Krishna, and 
therefore she went to search for him. When she entered the room, she 
saw Krishna standing on the ulukhala, a large mortar for grinding spices. 
Having turned the mortar upside down, he was stealing butter hanging 
from a swing and was distributing the butter to the monkeys. As soon as 
Krishna saw that His mother had come, He immediately began to run away, 
and mother Yasoda began to follow Him. After going some distance, 
mother Yasoda was able to catch Krishna, who because of His offense was 
crying. Mother Yasoda, of course, threatened to punish Krishna if he acted 
that way again, and she decided to bind him with rope. Unfortunately, 
when the time came to knot the rope, the rope with which she wanted to 
bind him was short by a distance equal to the width of two fingers. When she made the rope longer by adding another rope, she again saw that it 
was short by two fingers. Again and again she tried, and again and again 
she found the rope too short by two fingers. Thus she became very tired, 
and Krishna, seeing his affectionate mother so tired, allowed himself to be 
bound. Now, being compassionate, He did not show her His unlimited 
potency. After mother Yasoda bound Krishna and became engaged in other 
household affairs, Krishna observed two yamala-arjuna trees, which were 
actually Nalakuvara and Manigriva, two sons of Kuvera who had been 
condemned by Narada Muni to become trees. Krishna, by his mercy, now 
began to proceed toward the trees to fulfill the desire of Narada Muni.
