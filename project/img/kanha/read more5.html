    <p>Krishna's playmates complained to mother
        Yasoda that Krishna was eating earth. Mother Yasoda wanted to open Krishna's mouth to see the evidence so that she could chastise Him. Sometimes she assumed the position of a chastising mother, and at the next 
        moment she was overwhelmed with maternal love. Lord Sri Krishna said, My dear mother, I have never eaten dirt.  
        All My friends complaining against Me are liars. If you think they 
        are being truthful, you can directly look into my mouth and examine it.When Krishna opened His mouth wide by the order of mother 
        Yashoda, she saw within His mouth all moving and nonmoving entities, outer space, and all directions, along with mountains, islands, oceans, the surface of the earth, the blowing wind, fire, the 
        moon and the stars. She saw the planetary systems, water, light, 
        air, sky, and creation by transformation of ahaitkira. She also saw 
        the senses, the mind, sense perception, and the three qualities 
        goodness, passion and ignorance. She saw the time allotted for the 
        living entities, she saw natural instinct and the reactions of karma, 
        and she saw desires and different varieties of bodies, moving and 
        nonmoving. Seeing all these aspects of the cosmic manifestation, 
        along with herself and Vrndivana-dhima, she became doubtful 
        and fearful of her son's nature.</p>
