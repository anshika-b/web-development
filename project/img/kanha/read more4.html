    <p>When mother Yasoda was sitting with her child on her 
        lap, she suddenly observed that he had assumed the weight of the entire 
        universe. She was so astonished that she had to put the child down, and 
        in the meantime Trnavarta, one of the servants of Kamsa, appeared there 
        as a whirlwind and took the child away. The whole tract of land known as 
        Gokula became surcharged with dust, no one could see where the child had been taken, and all the gopis were overwhelmed because He had 
        been taken away in the dust storm. But up in the sky, the asura, being 
        overburdened by the child, could not carry the child far away, although 
        he also could not drop the child because the child had caught him so 
        tightly that it was difficult for him to separate the child from his body. 
        Thus Trnavarta himself fell down from a very great height, the child 
        grasping him tightly by the shoulder, and immediately died. The demon 
        having fallen, the gopfs picked the child up and delivered Him to the lap 
        of mother Yasoda. Thus mother Yasoda was struck with wonder, but because of yogamiiya's influence, no one could understand who Krishna was 
        and what had actually happened. Rather, everyone began to praise fortune for the child's having been saved from such a calamity. Nanda 
        Maharaja, of course, was thinking of the wonderful foretelling of 
        Vasudeva and began to praise him as a great yogi. </p>
