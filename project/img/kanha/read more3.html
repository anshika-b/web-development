    <p>One day, Putana arrived from outer space in Gokula, the home of 
        Nanda Maharaja, and by displaying her mystic power, she assumed the 
        disguise of a very beautiful woman. Taking courage, she immediately 
        entered Krishna's bedroom without anyone's permission; by the grace of 
        Krishna, no one forbade her to enter the house or the room, because that 
        was Krishna's desire. The baby Krishna, who resembled a fire covered by 
        ashes, looked upon Putana and thought that He would have to kill this 
        demon, the beautiful woman. Enchanted by the influence of yogamdya 
        and the Personality of Godhead, Putana took Krishna upon her lap, and 
        neither Rohini nor Yasoda objected. The demon Putana offered her 
        breast for Krishna to suck, but her breast was smeared with poison. The 
        child Krishna, therefore, squeezed Putana's breast so severely that in unbearable pain she had to assume her original body and fell to the ground. 
        Then Krishna began playing on her breast just like a small child. When 
        Krishna was playing, the gopis were pacified and took the child away to 
        their own laps. After this incident, the gopis took precautions because of 
        the attack of the Raksasi. Mother Yasoda gave the child her breast to suck 
        and then laid him in bed.
        Meanwhile, Nanda and his associates the cowherd men returned from 
        Mathura, and when they saw the great dead body of Putana, they were 
        struck with wonder. Everyone was astonished that Vasudeva had foretold 
        this mishap, and they praised Vasudeva for his power of foresight. The 
        inhabitants of Vraja cut the gigantic body of Putana into pieces, but because Krishna had sucked her breast, she had been freed from all sins, and 
        therefore when the cowherd men burned the pieces of her body in a fire, 
        the smoke filled the air with a very pleasing fragrance. Ultimately, although Putana had desired to kill Krishna, she attained the Lord's abode. 
        From this incident we gain the instruction that if one is attached to Krishna 
        somehow or other, even as an enemy, one ultimately attains success. 
        What then is to he said of devotees who are naturally attached to Krishna in 
        love? When the inhabitants of Vraja heard about the killing of Piitana 
        and the welfare of the child, they were very much satisfied. Nanda 
        Maharaja took the baby Krishna on his lap and was filled with satisfaction. </p>
